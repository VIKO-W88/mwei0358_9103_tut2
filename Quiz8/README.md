# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

__Example Petros Vrellis — Starry Night (interactive animation)__

I am inspired by the flowing brushstroke effect that responds to user interaction. Touching or moving the cursor changes the motion of the strokes and triggers subtle sound, enhancing immersion. This dynamic particle-based brush system preserves the original painting style while adding interactivity.

This technique allows viewers to actively participate, experiencing the movement of Van Gogh’s brushstrokes and interactive sound, aligning with assignment goals of visual impact and user engagement.
